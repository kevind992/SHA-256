# SHA-256
This repository contains the project submission for 4th year Software Development module, Theory of Algorithms. The following sections explain the preject specifications, the running of the application, the research involved and extras which were added.
## Project Specifcation
The aim was to write a program in the C programming language that calculates the SHA-256 checksum of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Secure
Hash Standard document supplied by the (United States) National Institute of Standards and Technology. The only pre-requisite was that the program
performs the algorithm â€” we were free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on. The recomendation was to allow the user to input some free text
or a filename via the command line.
## Running the Application
The following application running guide is guided towards systems which are running windows
